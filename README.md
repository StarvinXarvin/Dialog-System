# Dialog-System
My name is Xavi Alca√±iz, and I'm a Videogame Development student at CITM.
This repository offers an explanation of dialog systems, what types are there, examples of good dialogue in videogames, and a small program that shows how to implement a simple branching dialogue in a C++ application. To follow the explanation on how to implement it, simply download the repository, open the "Handout" project and follow the instructions written in the webpage. A solved project can also be found with the name "Solution".
